## Magic Card Stock Reader
The purpose of this project is to create a smart program that can predict when the price of a magic card will rise or fall.
There a couple of different variables to keep in mind when making this.
  * What format is it legal in?
  * What decks in the format play?
  * Do those decks have high win percents?
  * Has the deck won any big events as of recently?
  * Is the card banned in any formats?
  * How many times have they reprinted this card?
